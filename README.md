## How to use?

Node version >= 10 is required.
Please install the same from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then follow these steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/heIsThePirate/scrap-bot.git
cd scrap-bot
npm install
```
- Open the "scrape.js" file and edit the *url* and the *numberOfPages* to scrape from.
- Save the file

Run:
```shell
node scrape.js
```

A new '.xlsx' file with the scraped data would be generated in the same folder.
